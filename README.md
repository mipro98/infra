## Features

This playbook includes tasks for:
* Setting up the host system (packages, user, mounts,...).
* Deploying all docker services according to their docker-compose templates.
* Setting up fully automatic maintenance tasks like:
  * BTRFS snapshots and backups to a different drive using the [btrbk utility](https://digint.ch/btrbk/)
  * BTRFS scrubbing
  * S.M.A.R.T. monitoring with email notifications
  * automatic system and container updates.


Various configuration can be done using variables defined in `group_vars` or in `vault.yml`. For almost all files, [templates](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/template_module.html) are used to craft configuration files or docker-compose.yml files according to set variables.


<u>**This repo contains ready-to-use container setups for:**</u>
* Nextcloud ([with Mariadb, Redis, Cron, Collabora, Memories incl. hardware transcoding](#nextcloud-stack))
* A server monitoring stack with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter).
* Dokuwiki
* Gitea
* Homer
* Vaultwarden
* Traefik v2 as the central reverse proxy.

**_All these services are setup to be exposed through Traefik on different domains by simply providing domain names for the services in `vault.yml`._**

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `./git-init.sh`
3. (optionally: run `source unlock-bw.sh`)
4. Deploy (see below)


Deploy everything:
```bash
make deploy
```

* Deploy only host os system setup: `make system`
* Deploy only docker-compose changes: `make containers`
* Deploy only maintenance changes: `make maintenance`


## Ansible-Vault

This repo uses ansible-vault to encrypt secret variables used by Ansible (passwords, domain names, etc.). This affects the file `vars/vault.yml`. A template for `vault.yml` can be find in `vars/vault.yml.template` The password for the encryption is obtained by [bitwarden-cli](https://github.com/bitwarden/cli) in the script `vault-pass.sh`. Therefore you can encrypt and decrypt by just entering your bitwarden master password by just writing:

```bash
make encrypt
make decrpyt
```

**Always remember to encrypt the vault before commiting! Also, absolutely run the script `git-init.sh` after cloning to install a pre-commit hook which prevents committing the unencrypted vault!**

## Roles

The repo contains 3 ansible roles:
1. `system`
2. `containers`
3. `maintenance`


### `system` role

  * installs all packages defined in `extra_packages`
  * sets correct permissions for docker
  * sets fstab mount points for a "NAS" and a "BACKUP" drive
  * sets up `smartd` with a sane monitoring configuration and email alerts

_Note:_ SSH configuration is skipped for now.


### `container` role

* Creates the folder structure for docker-compose files according to enabled services
* Deploys the docker-compose.yml templates for the services in their respective folders
* Makes some special configuration for nextcloud, if nextcloud is enabled


### `maintenance` role

At the heart of the maintenance role is the script `mpserver-maintenance.sh` which gets deployed by ansible. Additionally:
* A systemd timer is set up which triggers above script every night at 2 A.M.
* The `btrbk.conf` file is deployed

Refer to section [Automatic Maintenance](#automatic-maintenance) for more details.

---
## Automatic Maintenance

The custom bash script `mpserver-maintenance.sh` gets triggered every night at 2 A.M. by systemd. Based on the time (or command line flags), it decides what actions to take:

* monthly tasks _(when script is triggered on last sunday of a month)_
* daily tasks _(when script is triggered on a sunday except the last sunday of a month)_
* weekly tasks _(when triggered all other days between 0 A.M. and 6 A.M.)_

The script can be triggered manually for daily, monthly or weekly tasks. Refer to `sudo ./mpserver-maintenance.sh --help`.

```
Usage: ./mpserver-maintenance.sh [<options>] [<command>]

Options:
	--dry-run	Don't execute anything, only show what would be executed
	--no-email	Don't send an email with the log
	--help		Show this help message and exit.

Commands:
	daily		Run daily maintenance tasks
	weekly		Run weekly maintenance tasks
	monthly	Run monthly maintenance tasks
	docker <cmd>	Run docker-compose <cmd> on all services

	If no command is passed, the script will determine the correct schedule and run the appropriate tasks.
```

The tasks are defined in the bash functions `weekly`, `monthly`, `daily`. Each trigger writes a detailed log into `~/maintenance/logs` which also gets emailed for `monthly` and `weekly` triggers.


**Daily tasks**:
1. Snapshot the subvolume "Daten" through btrbk

**Weekly tasks:**
1. backup `~/dockerdata` onto a backup location through rsync
2. snapshot _and_ backup all configured subvolumes according to `btrbk.conf`
3. update the host system
4. send an email with a the detailed log.

**Monthly tasks:**
1. backup `~/dockerdata` onto a backup location through rsync
2. snapshot _and_ backup all configured subvolumes according to `btrbk.conf`
3. update all containers (`docker-compose pull` all services)
4. prune old docker images and volumes
5. `btrfs-scrub` both the _NAS_ and the _BACKUP_ drive.
6. update the host system.
7. send an email with a the detailed log.

## Nextcloud stack


The Nextcloud stack is carefully fine-tuned for performance and simplicity using:

* A custom built Nextcloud image with `ffmpeg`, `imagemagick` and `ghostscript` for media previews.
* **MariaDB** for a performant database
* **Redis** for fast memory caching and Transactional File Locking _(I personally use APCu for caching and Redis only for File Locking)_
* A dedicated **go-vod** container with access to `/dev/dri` for hardware acceleration in Nextcloud Memories.
* A dedicated Nextcloud **cron** container <u>with mounted crontab file</u> so you can easily add cronjobs without messing on the host system's cron/systemd.
* A dedicated **Collabora** container for performant **Nextcloud Office** integration.

**Notes:**

* The nextcloud container will _not_ auto-update unless you run `docker-compose build --pull nextcloud` inside `~/docker/nextcloud` because the container is built using `~/docker/nextcloud/Dockerfile` in order to have ffmpeg support. Since Nextcloud updates often require manual intervention and can easily be discovered through the admin panel, this isn't that much of an issue.
* The [go-vod](https://github.com/pulsejet/go-vod) container needs to be built from the (locally cloned) github repository. Ansible takes care of cloning the go-vod repository from github in the right place when executing the `containers` role.
* I use [Nextcloud Memories](https://memories.gallery/) alongside [Preview Generator](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/previewgenerator) and [Recognize](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/recognize) without issues and with hardware transcoding using the seperate go-vod instance. To make it work, adjust the following in the _Memories_ Admin GUI:
  * enable "Images", "HEIC" and "Videos" under "File Support"
  * define `/usr/bin/ffmpeg` / `/usr/bin/ffprobe` as ffmpeg / ffprobe path
  * enable "external transcoder" and just write `go-vod:47788` under "Connection address" _(The Traefik DNS will resolve `go-vod` correctly within the docker proxy network)_.
  * tick "Enable acceleration with VA-API" to <u>on</u>. _(ignore the warning "VA-API device not found")_
  * (note that I added the cronjob for preview generator in the mounted `crontab-www-data` file.)
* **To enter the Nextcloud container** (e.g. to run `occ` commands), **run:**
    ```bash
    docker exec -itu www-data nextcloud bash
    ```

---

## Tips


* The `makefile` supports shorthands for often used Ansible commands. For example, when only modifying `mpserver-maintenance.sh`, just run `make script` and it will only replace the script on the server.
* Under **`~/docker/compose.sh`**, there exists a **convenience script for docker-compose** where you can execute actions on **all** containers at once. For example:
    ```bash
    ./compose down
    ./compose up -d
    ./compose pull
    ```
* Make sure to also re-deploy the maintenance script when adding/removing docker services in `group_vars` since the script will change according to the enabled services.
* Enable `debug_ports_open: true` to open ports on the host bypassing the reverse proxy. This can be used for debugging, e.g. Traefik metrics and node_exporter is usually not accessible outside of `traefik-net`.

## Credits

A large portion of the repository is inspired by [Alex Kretzschmar's infra repo](https://github.com/ironicbadger/infra) as well as [Wolfgang notthebee's infra repo](https://github.com/notthebee/infra). Also, both BTRFS maintenance and the system setup was largely inspired by [zilexa's Homeserver Guide](https://github.com/zilexa/Homeserver).

Thanks also goes to [Jeff Geerling's security role](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-security) where I took almost all of my (not yet activated) SSH configuration.
